Inferring Player Location in Sports Matches: Multi-Agent Spatial Imputation from Limited Observations. In Proceedings of the 2023 International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (pp. 1643-1651).
Description: Understanding agent behavior in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) is critical in fields like autonomous driving, disaster response, and sports analytics. This work tackles agent location imputation in environments with non-uniform timesteps and ~95% missing values. Using Long Short-Term Memory and Graph Neural Networks, we predict agent locations, applying this to football by imputing player locations from sparse event data. Our model increases accessibility to analysis such as physical metrics and pitch control without the need for costly optical tracking data.">

<p><strong>Description:</strong> Player injuries in soccer significantly impact team performance, club financial stability and player welfare, with the ‘Big Five’ European soccer leagues experiencing a staggering £513 million in injury-related costs during the 2021/22 season. In this paper, we present a novel forward-looking team selection model, framed as a Markov decision process and optimised with Monte Carlo tree search, that balances team performance with the risk of long-term player unavailability due to injury. We demonstrate that real-world teams could reduce the incidence of player injury by ~13% and wages inefficiently spent on injured players by ~11% using our data-driven team selection model.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> We introduce a novel method for assessing agent teamwork based on their spatial coordination. Our approach models the influence of spatial proximity on team formation and sustained spatial dominance over adversaries using a Multi-agent Markov Decision Process. We develop an algorithm to derive efficient teamwork strategies by combining Monte Carlo Tree Search and linear programming. When applied to team defence in football (soccer) using real-world data, our approach reduces opponent threat by 21%, outperforming optimised individual behaviour by 6%. Additionally, our model enhances the predictive accuracy of future attack locations and provides deeper insights compared to existing teamwork models that do not explicitly consider the spatial dynamics of teamwork.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> We present a spatial Expected Threat (xT) model that computes goal likelihood using spatial event data. Using this spatial xT model, we propose a novel way of valuing attacking and defensive units in football by computing a ‘Threat Above Expected’ (TAx) metric which measures the change in goal probability resulting specifically from spatial context. Using this metric, we evaluate team defences and attacks, and demonstrate a concept for a positional defensive optimiser that can offer coachable insights by identifying improvements in defensive setups during post-match analysis.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> We introduce GAPP, a Graph Attention Network model that predicts football pass reception probabilities and provides interpretable insights into off-ball defending. Using attention mechanisms, GAPP captures player interactions and introduces two new metrics to quantify defender contributions. We tested GAPP on 306 English Premier League matches, and showed it outperforms baselines for pass reception prediction, while offering unique insights for off-ball defender evaluation for coaches, scouts and teams. This work shows the potential of graph attention networks for analysing complex multi-agent systems like football.</p>
